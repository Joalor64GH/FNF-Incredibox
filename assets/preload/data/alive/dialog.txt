:PoloFeliz:another victory for Boyfriend!
:bfNormal:beep?
:PoloDuvida:what do you mean with we're the same?
:v5assustado:wait, you're saying I am like the crazy v3?
:v5assustado:my berg, never
:v3:negative energies will fall in those who despise
:v5normal:...
:v5normal:do you really think any of us are like this guy?
:v4normal:nobody here is the same
:PoloAtento:yea Boyfriend, none of us are the same
:v3:the difference is a relevant aspect for us
:PoloAtento:no one here is like the other
:PoloAtento:thinking better in appearance...
:PoloAtento:we are even a little similar
:v5normal:we are?
:v4normal:I'm more beautiful than you all
:v3:bragging will get you buried
:PoloAtento:putting it aside
:PoloFeliz:here we are! v6!
:PoloFeliz:also known as Alive
:PoloAtento:just as in Brazil, things here are also themed
:PoloFeliz:themed with Japanese culture to be specific
:PoloAtento:but unlike Brazil, people here are not native to Japan
:PoloAtento:they are from here, but decided to travel to Japan
:PoloAtento:and they liked it so much that they decided to make this version all themed in Japan
:PoloFeliz:that's why their music style is more oriental
:PoloTedio:but I'll be very clear
:PoloDeboche:the representative here sucks
:v5normal:dude, don't tell me about this guy, I even get mad
:PoloDeboche:the representative here is the "I'm better than others" type of person
:PoloDeboche:he always thinks he's the best, and as he said...
:PoloTedio:"I don't talk to people inferior to me"
:PoloDeboche:what an idiot
:bfNormal:beep?
:PoloDuvida:why don't they remove him from the position of representative?
:PoloDeboche:because whether likes it or not, he knows what he's doing
:PoloAtento:like, remember what I said about v4?
:PoloAtento:from there being so technological that there are androids that walk normally?
:bfNormal:bi
:PoloAtento:so...
:PoloAtento:let's say that here there is a much more advanced technology than there
:PoloAtento:so advanced that Alive is only not the most technological version because of v8
:PoloAtento:we haven't made it to v8 yet, there you'll understand what I'm talking about
:PoloAtento:in general about Alive
:PoloDeboche:he's the guy who makes this version go forward
:PoloDeboche:even though I don't like to say it...
:PoloDeboche:he's a great representative
:PoloAtento:let's start this song
:PoloNormal:*clears throat*
:PoloFeliz:hi v6! how's it going?
:v6:...
:v6:...
:v6:why are you all here?
:v6:I didn't call any of you
:PoloDeboche:remember that conversation about the Boyfriend guy
:v6:oh! were you serious?
:v6:I thought it was just your bullshit as usual
:v6:so... where's the Boyfriend?
:bfNormal:beep!
:v6:...
:v6:who brought the dwarf there?
:bfNormal:*angry beeps*
:v6:wait, is Boyfriend really that kiddo?
:v6:for a moment I thought you were joking off bringing dwarves now
:bfNormal:bop biop skeedp!
:v6:uh, ok Oompa Loompa
:v6:let's start this quick
:v6:you're already irritating me with that annoying voice of yours
:v6:I won't be surprised if you lose or give up
:bfNormal:beeeeep!
