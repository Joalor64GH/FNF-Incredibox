:PoloAtento:remember what I told you about v8 being the most advanced version in technology?
:bfNormal:beeeep
:PoloAtento:I wasn't kidding
:PoloAtento:and this place really creeps me out
:PoloAtento:the technology here has advanced so much that everyone here has merged with machines or turned into robots
:poloAtento:really this version lives up to its name
:bfNormal:beep?
:PoloAtento:Dystopia
:PoloAtento:this version is nothing but a huge dystopia
:PoloAtento:no one enters and no one leaves
:PoloAtento:and whoever enters here ends up regretting immensely
:PoloAtento:they only let you in because we talked about your battle with the rep
:PoloAtento:and they just let me in to guide you right here
:PoloAtento:so I'll stay in the corner
:PoloAtento:oh yea...
:PoloAtento:take this cloak here
:bfNormal:??
:PoloAtento:here in Dystopia there are several pyramid-shaped drones that keep searching
:PoloAtento:if they see that you are not a robot they will take you and turn you into one by force
:PoloAtento:forcing you to live in this dystopia
:PoloAtento:and look that in the worst case they would kill you right here
:PoloAtento:so when a drone arrives, wear this cloak to hide
:PoloAtento:just hold Spacebar player
:bfNormal:bop?
:PoloDuvida:Where did I get this cloak and find out about these things?
:PoloAtento:a friend of mine
:PoloAtento:he's tired of this dystopia
:PoloAtento:someday he will go to the core of this city to try to end with it
:PoloAtento:I'm rooting for him
:PoloNormal:*expires deep*
:PoloAtento:good luck Astra Makula...
:PoloAtento:when you finish, call me because I want to get out of here soon
:bfNormal:...
:v8normal:...
:v8normal:you're the Boyfriend right?
:bfNormal:...
:bfNormal:beep!
:v8normal:good, let's get started before you get trapped in here
