:v4preocupado:what do you mean v1?

:PoloAssustado:always wanting Boyfriend to die
:v5assustado:what meu truta?
:v6:where is this going?
:v7normal:the worst is that it's true

:gf:...
:gf:what?
:v2normal:I talked to your father
:v2normal:remember I was wanting a rematch with Boyfriend?
:v4preocupado:yes?
:v2normal:he made me realize that a rematch wouldn't be worth it
:v2final:and that the best way to end this would be to kill Boyfriend
:PoloAssustado:v2 are you going crazy?
:v6:dude, even i wouldn't get to that point
:v2final:you wouldn't get to that point because you don't realize!
:v2final:Boyfriend just showed up here to humiliate us and our game
:v2final:when he leaves here he will laugh at us and say how pathetic we are
:v5assustado:v2 what is this? you are not like that!
:v7normal:yeah! and the little I saw Boyfriend, he would never do such a thing
:v2normal:you guys are like Dearest told me, a bunch of idiots
:v2final:after killing Boyfriend I will annihilate Incredibox
:PoloAssustado:v2 what's going on? you would never think of doing that
:gf:it was my dad
:PoloAssustado:what? how?
:gf:he messed with v2's head
:gf:like, literally, with powers and stuff
:gf:my dad put these thoughts into v2 and now v2 acts like they're his
:gf:not to mention that my dad probably gave v2 powers to kill Boyfriend
:PoloAssustado:and is there anything you can do?
:gf:yes
:gf:Boyfriend!
:bfShit:
:gf:sing the rematch he so wanted while I take these thoughts out of him
:gf:if you don't battle him now he kills us in the blink of an eye
:v2final:yeah Boyfriend! let's have a rematch!
:PoloAssustado:OH WHAT?!
:PoloAssustado:does he kill us in the blink of an eye?
:gf:yup
:PoloAssustado:and why aren't you scared!?
:gf:because I know my boyfriend will solve this
:gf:right? sweetie
:bfShit:
:bfShit:oh shit
