:PoloFeliz:and Incredibox, as well as your game, involves music too
:PoloFeliz:and we saw that you and Friday Night Funkin' are quite famous out there
:PoloAtento:and then we had the idea to call you here to see "which game is better"
:PoloTedio:this question isn't really serious
:PoloFeliz:we just want to make a friendly challenge between games, you know?
:PoloFeliz:and at the end, jokingly decide which game is the best
:bfNormal:bep
:PoloFeliz:ok then
:PoloAtento:well, about the "we" part I was saying...
:PoloAtento:is that there are several different communities here on Incredibox
:PoloAtento:eight to be specific
:PoloAtento:the communities here are called versions
:PoloFeliz:and each version has its own style of music.
:bfNormal:beep bep

:PoloAtento:and each version has its representative
:PoloFeliz:that's where the "we" fits in
:PoloFeliz:the representatives of each version want to challenge you
